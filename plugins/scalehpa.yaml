  shortDescription: Wraps "kubectl scale" when keda is being used
  version: v0.0.1-alpha5
  description: |
    Allows use of "kubectl scale"-like command when keda is installed,
    patching the scaledobject to the correct number of minReplicaCount.
  caveats: |
    Only works with statefulset and deployment. Does not check reason for errors when
    patching the scaledobject. Requires previous installation of 'getopt' on MacOS
